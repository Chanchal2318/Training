// Props

// 1. It is used when we have to send data  along with component call

// for ex:- <App data={name}/> . It is received in props in a component

// 2. We can send multiple values during a function call , but they all can received in a single parameter called 'props' and all values can stay together in a form of an object.

// 3. Props are immutable -> No changes are allowed

// 4. We have to install a dependancy called 'props-Type' to use the feature of props

// 5. All object are send into {} curly brackets except string as they are send into single-quote '' or double-quote "".

// 6. We can also set validation in a component to restrict the datatype of the particular props.

// 7. We can set defaultProps for the situation in which we don't receive any prop then we will use the defaultProps .

// 8. If we have both default as well as prop send by the user then we always give priority to the props send by the user.
